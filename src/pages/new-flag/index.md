## New Flag

Aye mates, I've paid a witch who were good with lights and colours to pull from the nether this new flag design. A few likes on instagram wouldn't hurt.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[Calico Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Jack).

>Rackham made a career of plundering small vessels close to shore once he became captain. He and his crew captured the Kingston, a small Jamaican vessel, and made it their flagship. They made several conquests in the West Indies, taking a couple of large ships off of Bermuda.

>In 1719, Rackham sailed into Nassau in the Bahamas, taking advantage of a general amnesty for pirates to obtain a royal pardon and commission from Governor Woodes Rogers. Rogers had been sent to the Bahamas to address the problem of pirates in the Caribbean who had started to attack and steal from British ships
